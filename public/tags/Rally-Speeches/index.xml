      <description>&lt;p&gt;Friends, ladies and gentlemen, let me start with a story.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Seven years ago, I took a boat cruise in Marina Bay and to Sentosa island and St John&amp;#8217;s Island. On this boat, was Mr. Lim Kim San and the Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew. What was I doing with these 2 wise men on a boat?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was the time we were trying to decide whether or not to have the integrated resorts with casinos in Singapore and we also trying to decide where to place these 2 integrated resorts. At the end of the cruise, as the boat came back to marina bay, this was before the barrage was built so you could sail into Marina Bay, nice sunset, and in front of us you could see the beautiful skyline, Shenton Way and the Singapore downtown.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear friends, residents, of Holland-Bukit Timah and Bukit Panjang, it is a very special moment for me to stand here before you in this field. I see so many of you here, including my father, my wife in the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just now, Mr Liang Eng Hwa said he was educated in Bukit Panjang English School. 57 years ago, my father and my mother were teachers in Bukit Panjang school. That&amp;#8217;s where they met and as a result, I am here. The school has shifted a bit, but the actual site is Ten Mile Junction where the LRT is. Every time I drive past there, I am reminded that this place is special.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
