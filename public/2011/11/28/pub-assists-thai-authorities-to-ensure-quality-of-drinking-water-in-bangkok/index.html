PUB has delivered 50 units of online pH- and turbidity-sensors to the MWA to enhance the monitoring of water quality in the treatment process in Bangkok. In addition, the MWA has accepted PUB&#8217;s offer to provide training, in partnership with industry partners, to MWA staff on risk assessment and water safety plan formulation; as well as to provide laboratory services for testing of water samples from MWA. A four-member team from PUB had visited Bangkok earlier, from 10 to 12 November, to carry out an assessment of the assistance needed. PUB&#8217;s Chief Executive, Chew Men Leong, was in Bangkok on 26 November to meet with the MWA Governor, Charoen Passara, and oversee the implementation of the assistance initiatives.">
