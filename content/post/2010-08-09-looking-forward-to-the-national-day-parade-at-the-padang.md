<p>The last time I was at the Padang for the NDP was in 1987. I was a Medical Staff Officer in National Service. My medical colleagues and I were part of the team responsible for providing medical coverage for the event. I remember having a great view from the roof top of the City Hall. The view today will be even more amazing.</p>

<p>How time has flown !</p>
