<p>Thank you for giving our team the privilege to serve you for the next 5 years in Holland-Bukit Timah.</p>

<p>We have heard your voice. We will continue to listen, to reflect, and to act on the many lessons you have taught us. We thank you for your time and patience. There is still much to be done.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>We will serve with all our heart. For those who did not support us – let us work harder to rebuild our relationship with you.</p>

<p>We must also express our gratitude to the hundreds of volunteers who have walked beside us. You have been an inspiration.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Let us work together to secure a brighter future for Singapore, and for our families. We will continue to protect what you hold dearest.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
