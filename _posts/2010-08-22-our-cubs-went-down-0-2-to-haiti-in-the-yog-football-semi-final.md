<p>It just wasn&#8217;t our night. Our boys couldn&#8217;t get into their usual rhythm. In the first half, and conceded a goal. They came out fighting in the second half, and had several chances, but no luck.</p>

<p>When we conceded a penalty and were reduced to 10 men, it was over. I told the cubs we were all proud of them, and will stand by them. Next match on Wednesday 25 August 2010.</p>
