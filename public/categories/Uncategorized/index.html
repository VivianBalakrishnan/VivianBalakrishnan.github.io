<p>(Why did you choose this place – Senja-Cashew Community Club – to meet for supper?)</p>
<p>This place has special significance. Back in 2006, we decided to build a pool in Bukit Panjang. However, it was supposed to be in another location further south.</p>
<p>My first post-election block visit was to a block opposite here. At the end of the visit, the grassroots leaders went to the top, looked down, saw this pond (by the current location of Senja-Cashew CC), and said, &#8220;Actually, the pond is the centre of the town. So, instead of building the pool in the original site, let&#8217;s build it here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edited excerpts of a speech I made at a NUS Commencement Ceremony on 14 July 2013.</p>
<p>Good morning and congratulations to those of you who are receiving your degrees today, and even heartier congratulations to the families that stand behind each one of you this morning.</p>
<p>There is a great difficulty in making speeches like this – I could read from the prepared text or I could tell you how I feel. If you do not mind, I want to tell you how I feel, not as a Minister, but speaking as someone who has walked in the shoes of everyone of you today, who is receiving a post-graduate degree.</p>

      <p>Many well-intended people advised me not to pursue this saga. It was too mundane, and people wanted to move on.</p>
<p>But I felt duty bound to resolve this matter, because it goes far beyond clean ceilings.</p>
<p>The core issue is integrity.</p>
<p>The Property Manager of AHPETC, Mr Tai Vie Shun, demanded extra money from hawkers for cleaning the high areas of hawker centres. He did so on three occasions – 8 March 2013, 26 April 2013 and 28 April 2013. The hawkers have confirmed this consistently, and their account is backed up by notes of meetings.</p>

<p>Dear Prime Minister Lee and Minister of Environment and Water Resources Vivian,I write to the both of you because I and my society view&#8217;s this as a serious concern and it requires more</p>
<p>concerted and sustainable effort from the top right down to the bottom.</p>
<p>If you think we are a gracious society and very well behaved today, think again. At a recent public event (presumably attended mainly by our young population), the litter left behind on the floating platform gallery seats was really a sight to remember – it was appalling and frankly quite disgraceful. I am quite sure that the performers from Korea would have been shocked to see such an aftermath! The media gave good coverage on disappointed fans, but, nothing was mentioned about the mess left behind after the event.</p>

<p>Just returned from Indonesia where I met ministers responsible for the environment from  Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand at the 14th Meeting of the Sub-Regional Ministerial Steering Committee (MSC) on Transboundary Haze Pollution.</p>
<p>We agreed that errant plantation companies and land owners should be held responsible and accountable for much of the haze pollution as they, rather than small shift cultivation farmers, were the major cause of the problem. We need more effective deterrent and enforcement measures against offenders.</p>

      <p>A good friend Mr Jamal bin Dhari passed away early this morning.</p>
<p>He was a very good man, who used to drive me to many functions when I was at MND 10 years ago. When I apologised for making him work such long hours, his reply conveyed much political wisdom.</p>
<p>He told me that we should always try our best to accept all invitations because people wanted to know their leaders personally.</p>
