Dr Teo has served in Bukit Panjang for almost twenty years, most of which as Chairman of the Town Council. He is also been Mayor of North West CDC. He knows everyone, every nook and cranny of his constituency and indeed our entire GRC. Both he and I have been here since the original formation of the GRC in 2001.">

<p>To care for you, protect your families, invest and build our collective destiny together - Sim Ann, Liang Eng Hwa, Christopher de Souza and I promise, as we have just announced that we will stand for election in Holland-Bukit Timah GRC. Dr Teo Ho Pin will stand again in Bukit Panjang SMC.</p>
<p>Dr Teo has served in Bukit Panjang for almost twenty years, most of which as Chairman of the Town Council. He is also been Mayor of North West CDC. He knows everyone, every nook and cranny of his constituency and indeed our entire GRC. Both he and I have been here since the original formation of the GRC in 2001.</p>
<p>We stand not just on our track record of work done on the ground and in Parliament, but also on our detailed plans for the future of our area. These are practical plans that have been generated after extensive consultations with our residents.</p>
<p>Our residents know us very well by now. They know our values, what we stand for, our emphasis on quick action, our attention to details and total commitment to every single resident.</p>
<p>Bukit Panjang town, Bukit Timah, Clementi and Ulu Pandan have been transformed over the past decade and a half. We are fortunate to have many residents and extended families who have lived here for many decades. They are the best judges of this transformation.</p>
<p>We have worked hard to improve transport and increase community facilities. At the same time, this is also perhaps the greenest constituency as we include much of the Nature Reserve. We have increased access to our natural heritage in a sensitive and sustainable manner.</p>
<p>But this election is more than just a local election. It is about the future direction of Singapore and the people you trust to lead Singapore into the future.</p>
<p>Much has been achieved in Singapore over 50 years. But our future challenges are no less profound.</p>
<p>We have to completely restructure our economy - to one based on value creation, innovation and enterprise. We have to keep creating good jobs for everyone. Our education system and life long learning journeys have to give us future skills for future good jobs. At the same time, we have to ensure equity and social mobility - hallmarks of a fair and just society. We also have to deal with the consequences of one of the fastest ageing societies in the world. Our retirement and healthcare systems have to be sustainable for the long term.</p>
<p>We believe in growth, hard work, innovation, opportunities for all and active intervention to uplift the most vulnerable in our society.</p>
<p>But beyond the arguments on policy, the voters will also have to decide who they trust with their children&rsquo;s future. Character, integrity and honesty are non-negotiable for the PAP. Many people ask us why we are so obsessed with it. We believe this is the first prerequisite of public office.</p>
<p>I am sure the voters will scrutinise the candidates very carefully. Our promise to our residents is that we will continue to care for you, protect your families, invest and build our collective destiny together.</p>
