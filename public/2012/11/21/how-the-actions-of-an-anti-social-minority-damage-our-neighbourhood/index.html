<p>—————————————————————-</p>
<p>Dear Dr Balakrishnan</p>
<p>Thank you for your very prompt reply.</p>
<p>I do agree with you that we should not sacrifice convenience for majority just because of a few black sheep.</p>
<p>It will be great if the Resident Committee can survey the concerns of the residents and from there make an informed decision regarding the best course of action.</p>
<p>Yes PLEASE upload the photograph and our correspondence in your facebook. It will be most ideal should those culprits see the effects of their inconsiderate actions.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and your efforts.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Mr Z</p>

<p>Dear Mr Z</p>
<p>Thank you for your email. The litter left behind by theinconsiderate users of the void deck furniture is deplorable.Unfortunately, this is the type of situation that our cleaners face on many mornings when they commence their rounds.</p>
<p>Your observation that public hygiene in Japan is better than ours is, unfortunately, quite accurate. Public areas in Japan and Korea are cleaner, not because they have more cleaners or cameras or fines- but because of self discipline and peer pressure.</p>
<p>The question is whether we should aim higher, and how to do so.</p>
<p>I believe we must try harder. Public education, peer pressure,enforcement and cleaning must go hand-in-hand. And we are trying tostep up our efforts on all these fronts.</p>
<p>Specifically on the problem of void deck litter, two upcoming developments are worth highlighting. The Ministry of Home Affairs has announced that more video cameras will be installed in void decks, car-parks and public areas. In addition, I have just announced an increase in the composition fine for littering to $500 for the first offence.</p>
<p>The related question is what to do about our current public areasand facilities. Void deck furniture is a case in point. Installing and maintaining this furniture is not a trivial exercise. The TownCouncil will not do so unless residents specifically ask for these facilities. On the other hand, we also have to deal with inconsiderate behaviour of the small minority of anti-social users.</p>
<p>Should we remove this convenience for the majority because of theactions of a minority?</p>
<p>There are no easy answers – and I think this question is best answered by the resident themselves. I will request the ResidentsCommittee to seek the residents views, and then advise the Town Council to take the appropriate action.</p>
<p>As the issue which you have raised is not unique to this block only, I would also like to seek your permission to upload this photograph and our correspondence to my Facebook page. I will delete your name and phone number.</p>
<p>Please let me know if this is OK with you.</p>

<p>Subject: Re: Resident Matters</p>
<p>Dear Dr Balakrishnan</p>
<p>I wrote to you on a few occasion regarding the benches and table atthe void deck of Block Z zzz Road. I voiced my concerns aboutthe potential litter problem with the building of the benches and tables. The last incident I wrote to you was about a group of youngsters playing with fire and candles on the table itself.</p>
<p>This time, I am writing to you again about the unacceptable state ofcleanliness and litter caused by inconsiderate users. I am not sureif the litter is caused by the residents but ever since the tableand benches were built, it has attracted a lot of outsiders bringingfood there and leaving their litter behind.</p>
<p>I am a resident of this block and I have to face this sorry state of affairs on a daily basis. It is easy to view educating the public about cleanliness as a front line approach but sadly Singapore has along way to go in terms of social graciousness and civic mindedness.I went to Japan last month and their state of cleanliness is highly commendable. We are probably decades behind them.</p>
<p>So when do we draw the line between education and enforcement? At this point, i would say that enforcement is the way to go. I voiced my concerns last year about the potential problem and it was self-fulfilled. Litter became a problem and so was vandalism.</p>
<p>Please take a look at the photo which i took at 635am this morning. Is this acceptable? I am merely reflecting my views about having a clean and green environment but sadly with the table and benches, i am deprived of this very basic right to a clean area.</p>
<p>It is easy for outsiders to take things for granted and this problemis exacerbated by the coffee shop which is just next to the block.ANd there were occasions where groups of people congregated with beer cans and drinking bouts were conducted there. As a resident, I dont feel comfortable nor safe.</p>
<p>I requested for the table and benches to be removed in the previous emails. One set of table and benches were removed. What about this current set? Why remove one and keep the other and thus perpetuated the problem?</p>
<p>Cleaning daily and having more cleaners did not change the mindsetof these inconsiderate users.</p>
<p>I seek a solution to this problem as I view it as a long term issue. May I have a response please?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Mr Z</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for bringing this matter up again. We will have torepair</p>
<p>the vandalism, try to identify the culprits and review theoriginal</p>
<p>proposal again. We will re-consult the residents of the block on</p>
<p>whether they still want these amenities.</p>
<p>Please stay in touch.</p>

<p>in on the 13 July voicing out my concerns regarding erecting the</p>
<p>tables and benches on the void deck of Block Z zzz Road. Please</p>
<p>find your email appended below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am writing to you once again regarding this issue because</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I witnessed a very dismal and ugly incident yesterday 10</p>
<p>September Saturday. I was on my way home and I saw a group of very</p>
<p>young children playing with fire on the ground near to the grass patch.</p>
<p>AsI walked into the void deck, I realised that the table had</p>
<p>been vandalised. Since I did not see them set fire to the table, I</p>
<p>have no evidence to accuse them. Based on consequential events and</p>
<p>since they were playing with fire nearby, I infer that they were the</p>
<p>ones who set fire to the table. (Please see the photos attached).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your email, you said that residents requested for thetables.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do see a few residents using them for chit chat sessions but</p>
<p>mostly,the tables were used by NON-RESIDENTS. They brought their food</p>
<p>and dirtied the surroundings as they failed to clean up</p>
<p>after themselves. This was my initial apprehension about suchtables.</p>
<p>They attract the wrong crowd! And my initial apprehension has</p>
<p>become reality! There was once I saw a group of teenagers who brought</p>
<p>cupnoodles from the nearby plaza just to be eaten at the void deck</p>
<p>of block 165. Its fine to be eating there but they failed to clean</p>
<p>up thereafter. The half filled cups were spilled all over and</p>
<p>dirtied the surrounding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You also mentioned that in some estates, residents are mindful</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and it is a win win situation. However I cannot say the same for</p>
<p>my block. Its definitely not a win win situation. In fact,</p>
<p>the vandalised table is an EYE SORE.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is exactly what I was apprehensive about when I wrote to</p>
</blockquote>
<p>youback in July. I knew that such things would happen and when they</p>
<p>do,they leave behind very unpleasant sentiments. Kindly refer to</p>
<p>the pictures attached. The pictures speak for themselves and it</p>
<p>is evident that my initial apprehension is not based on</p>
<p>unfounded personal feelings. I had experienced this before in my</p>
<p>previous estate and now I am reliving it once again. It is notnice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps you can understand my initial concerns and how</p>
</blockquote>
<p>frustratingit is to me now that this ugly incident had indeed verified</p>
<p>my concerns?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you.</p>
