<p>Soft launch of our brand new sports complex and community facilities tomorrow for residents living in the Cashew, Zhenghua and Bukit Timah divisions.</p>

<p>The location and special design originated from my first block visit in the area in 2006, when grassroots leaders suggested that having sports facilities built into the slope adjacent to Pang Sua pond (opposite Bukit Panjang plaza) would be unique and convenient for residents in all 3 divisions.</p>

<p>We have an Olympic sized pool, childrens play pool, jacuzzi, 8 badminton courts, 2 tennis courts, street football, gymnasium, dance studios and numerous function rooms.</p>

<p>Please come and check it out, and let me know your suggestions.</p>

<p>This is one project that has evolved from an idea, discussions, detailed plans, construction, and is now ready for our residents.</p>

<p>I am very grateful to everyone who has worked so hard on this project.</p>
