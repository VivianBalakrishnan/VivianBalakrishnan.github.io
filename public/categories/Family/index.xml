My parents are now together again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We would like to thank all of you for the solace from your kind condolence messages. I am sorry that I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to respond individually.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I made this tribute in honour of my father&amp;rsquo;s life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My father was the most cheerful, caring and loyal man I have ever known.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By day, he has to deal with the haze, floods and other acts of God, but by night, Environment and Water Resources Minister Vivian Balakrishnan is a self-confessed techie who fixes his own gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a boy, he began by hacking computer games.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;As far as games were concerned, I wasn&amp;#8217;t very good at them,&amp;#8221; he said with a laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I learnt to program in order to hack the games,&amp;#8221; said Dr Balakrishnan, 53.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It brought back many fond memories as my friend and I watched our sons don the same uniforms that we wore 45 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A new beginning for all our children – and may they fulfill all their dreams and destinies along the &amp;#8216;path of the infinite&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was reminded of the wise words of Kahlil Gibran on Children – words that I believe all parents should reflect on :&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There were fewer residents than usual, but I was so grateful that we had a full complement of volunteers who were prepared to sacrifice time for a cause.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The combination of a festive air and basic challenges of life gave us food for thought as we shared a meal after the session.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We&#39;re trying to encourage more fathers to get involved in schools, to be a part of an environment that imparts values, attitudes and perspectives of our children.  Remember, it&#39;s a one-way ticket, so don&#39;t miss this ride. … It is the best part of life!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
