<p>Dr Teo has served in Bukit Panjang for almost twenty years, most of which as Chairman of the Town Council. He is also been Mayor of North West CDC. He knows everyone, every nook and cranny of his constituency and indeed our entire GRC. Both he and I have been here since the original formation of the GRC in 2001.</p>

<p>Speech by Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, Committee of Supply Debate, 11 March 2014 (Section A)</p>
<p>Date Published: 11 Mar 2014</p>
<p>1.      Mdm Chair, my colleagues in NEA, PUB and MEWR have had a very busy year. In the space of 12 months, we have had to confront the worst haze episode ever; the worst dengue outbreak ever; we still had a couple of localised flash floods to deal with, and now we have the most prolonged dry spell ever. February has been the driest month on record and also the windiest month on record. We seem to be bent on breaking new records all the time.</p>

<p>Hindi Centres 2012 Concert</p>
<p>Excerpts of a speech delivered on 22 July 2012 to commemorate the Hindi Centres Day.</p>
<p>Mr Vijay Kumar Rai, President of the Hindi Society Singapore; Members of the Management Committee of the Hindi Society and Hindi Centres,</p>
<p>We are here today to celebrate 23 years of really heartfelt volunteerism. I see many of you in this room that I recognise, and was also introduced to Mrs Sharma, whom I understand has been a teacher in the Hindi Centre since it started in August 1990.</p>

      <p>I remember meeting him 24 years ago at a party hosted by my mentor Professor. Arthur Lim. They were classmates in medical school and life long friends.</p>
<p>He introduced himself as &#8220;I am Lim Hock Siew, and just came out of prison a few years ago!&#8221;</p>
<p>We had a good chat and he freely shared his life experiences. I was struck by the absence of bitterness despite all his sacrifices. I think he knew in his heart that he was a patriot, and was proud that he never gave in.</p>

      <p>This is an excerpt of a speech I gave in Parliament in 2009. This issue remains &#8216;live&#8217;. We must acknowledge the valid concerns of Singaporeans about the pace of immigration and whether our infrastructure development has kept pace. We must reaffirm that Singaporean will always come first. We need an open constructive discussion about this and other sensitive issues. But we can do so in a civil and constructive tone.</p>
