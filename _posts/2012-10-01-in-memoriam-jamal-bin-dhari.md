<p>A good friend Mr Jamal bin Dhari passed away early this morning.</p>

<p>He was a very good man, who used to drive me to many functions when I was at MND 10 years ago. When I apologised for making him work such long hours, his reply conveyed much political wisdom.</p>

<p>He told me that we should always try our best to accept all invitations because people wanted to know their leaders personally.</p>

<p>I was asked to convey the news to him last week that his illness was terminal. I told him that we could never return to the past, but he could count his blessing, including a wonderful family. He added, &#8220;and good friends&#8221;.</p>

<p>I was fortunate to have met him when I first started out in politics, to become his friend and will remember him dearly.</p>
