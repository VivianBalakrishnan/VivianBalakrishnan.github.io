<p>Bukit Panjang Primary School will always be special for me. Both my parents were teachers in the school during the 1950s. In fact, that&#8217;s where they met and fell in love. So in a sense, I owe my existence to this school.</p>

<p>Even today, many people still come up to tell me that my parents taught them so many years ago.</p>
