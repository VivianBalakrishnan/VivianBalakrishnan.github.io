<p>Young Maori teenagers put up a moving and meaningful ceremony for everyone present, including the Governor-General of New Zealand Sir Anand Satyanand. It was a wonderful demonstration of the importance of knowing your roots, reaffirming your values and being able to do so while appreciating and welcoming people from different cultures with respect and grace.</p>

<p>Sports – the celebration of the apex of human performance – only makes sense when we start off by acknowledging our common humanity. If we can use the YOG to transmit this message to young people, then all our efforts would have been worthwhile.</p>
