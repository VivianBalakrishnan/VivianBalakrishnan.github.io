<p>The sun finally sets on the final day of existence of the Singapore Youth Olympic Village. Volunteers and staff still hard at work helping the remaining athletes catch their flights tonight and tomorrow.</p>

<p>We have truly been blessed to have such outstanding people working on this project. Diligent, meticulous and cheerful all the way! I have learnt that Singaporeans (and friends of Singapore) are truly capable of great things. I am more confident and optimistic about our future than I have ever been. Thank you all for the experience of a lifetime.!</p>
