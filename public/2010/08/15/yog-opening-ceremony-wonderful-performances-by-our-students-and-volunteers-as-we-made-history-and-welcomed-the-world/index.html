<p>We had some anxious moments at the beginning. At 7:10 pm, BG Ishak informed me that the weather forecast was for a big thunderstorm. Ishak, Kee Nguan and I rushed up to the stands to see for ourselves huge ominous dark clouds. BUT it wasn&#8217;t raining yet. And the wind was blowing towards the sea.</p>
<p>We were sure that Singaporeans would not be deterred by rain even if it came.</p>
<p>We decided to proceed with the show (and prayed).</p>
<p>It was only after 8 pm when BG Ishak informed me on the hotline that the weather forecast had improved that I could finally relax and enjoy the show. We were blessed last night.</p>
