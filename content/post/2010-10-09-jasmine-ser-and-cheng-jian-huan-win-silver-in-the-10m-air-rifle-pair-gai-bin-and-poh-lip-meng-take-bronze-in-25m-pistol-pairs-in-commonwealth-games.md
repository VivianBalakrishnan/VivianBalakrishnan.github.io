<p>Jasmine and Jian Huan saw an early lead erode as the Malaysian pair overtook them in the latter stage with a 793 to 790 point victory. I had a chance to chat with both of them before presenting them with scarves at the Victory Ceremony. Jasmine developed dry eyes mid way, and despite eye drops just couldn&#8217;t clear her eyes well enough. Poor Jian Huan was nursing a flu, and fighting drowsiness. Nevertheless, it was an excellent performance, and they have another day of competition tomorrow.</p>

<p>Gai Bin and Lip Meng took a bronze, just losing the silver by one point. Unfortunately Lip Meng had one shot that misfired. That made all the difference.
All the best for tomorrow! Next, table tennis men&#8217;s final tonight.</p>
