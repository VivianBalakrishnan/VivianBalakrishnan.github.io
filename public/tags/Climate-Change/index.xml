In the space of 12 months, we have had to confront the worst haze episode ever; the worst dengue outbreak ever; we still had a couple of localised flash floods to deal with, and now we have the most prolonged dry spell ever. February has been the driest month on record and also the windiest month on record. We seem to be bent on breaking new records all the time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The haze &amp;#8211; and what a difference three weeks make</title>

I thanked Singaporeans for your calmness, patience, and the fact that you refused to get rattled by the situation. It is that ability to respond sensibly, rationally, cohesively and collectively as a people that makes the difference and makes me confident that we will get through this together, whatever happens.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sustainable development makes good business sense, especially in Singapore</title>

      <description>&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;http://vivian.balakrishnan.sg/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3077.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_3077&#34; /&gt;&#xA;&lt;figcaption&gt;IMG_3077&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The world is currently at several inflexion points. There are now more than seven billion human beings on the planet, and more than half of us live in cities. Indeed, the most essential elements of life – food, water – are now interlinked with energy, and with fossil fuels. And this portends therefore, either a potential crisis or enormous opportunities for businesses in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the past, great fortunes were made by simply extracting resources, mining materials – iron ore and energy – from the ground. And manufacturing grew enormously, on the back of the availability of cheap resources and cheap energy. But this era of cheap natural resources is coming to a close.  And we can now no longer afford to ignore the externalities of industrialisation and of human activities.  Pollution and global warming are real phenomena,  which affect not just the quality of the environment, but also involves huge economic costs for all of us. In other words, the old ways of getting rich are not going to be viable in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Our world is changing profoundly at an unprecedented rate. We need a coalition of the government, private companies and NGOs to protect human welfare, the fragile ecosystem and biodiversity. We have to get the economics right too.

Let me cite a few of these.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, our world population has now exceeded seven billion. Clearly, that is unprecedented. Not only that, but for the first time ever in human history, more than half of all human beings live in a city, and not in the rural countryside. This is another world first.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why governments, private sector and citizens all over the world need to collectively confront the looming crises of demographics, urbanisation, food-water-energy shortages, biodiversity, environmental integrity and human welfare

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I attended the launch of the Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity for Business Coalition on 6 November 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Our world has rapidly passed through a series of inflexion points.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;First, our world population has exceeded 7 billion.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Second, more than half of all human beings live in cities.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Third, the age of cheap and plentiful natural resources – when we could literally scrape coal, iron ore, oil, gas easily from the surface of the planet – is ending.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fourth, we are running out of fresh water on a global scale.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fifth, the nexus between energy, water and food means we desperately need another agricultural revolution in the next decade or so.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sixth, we cannot afford to continue to simply dump pollutants, waste, toxins and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and seas regardless of their impact on human health and safety and planetary ecology.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Seventh, globalisation and information revolution has created enormous opportunities for billions of people from developing countries, but it has also created enormous competitive pressure on everyone. It has completely transformed the nature and value of employment and enterprise in half a century – probably a rate of change that is unparalleled in human history. It has also increased disparities between those able to exploit opportunities and those left behind.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sustainable development&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Build the most beautiful city you can; plant as many trees as you can; invest in the latest technology; conserve water, energy and resources; and find honest, competent and visionary leadership

Professor Tommy Koh, who was the moderator, asked:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Minister, my question to you is two-fold. First, this plenary brings together our colleagues from water, city and the environment. What is the common thread that ties the three together, and what are some lessons learned that you would like to share with us?&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

It has been a mind blowing journey traversing ecology, urbanisation, climate change, transgenic crops, nuclear energy and geoengineering. We don&amp;#8217;t have to agree on everything, but we must think carefully through these issues, and be prepared to change our minds as new information emerges.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Climate change negotiations proceeding glacially</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2011/09/13/climate-change-negotiations-proceeding-glacially/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2011/09/13/climate-change-negotiations-proceeding-glacially/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, I attended an informal ministerial meeting on climate change in Pretoria, South Africa, and experienced first hand the enormous difficulties the negotiators are facing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The crux of the negotiations is to achieve the stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere. The current goal is to limit the rise of global temperatures to less than 2 degrees centigrade. This is the level that the scientists have told us is necessary to avoid catastrophic climatic instability. However, there is currently a big gap between this goal and the current pledges by the international community. The United Nations Environment Programme Report published last year indicated a clear gap of at least 5 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide per year even in the best case scenario.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
