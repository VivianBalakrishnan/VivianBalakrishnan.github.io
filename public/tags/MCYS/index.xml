It has been an exciting and deeply fulfilling journey over 7 years. I have been most privileged to have the support of wonderful colleagues, volunteers and members in the ministry, statutory boards, and the various committees and councils, as well as all my friends on this page.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I first arrived at MCYS in 2004, I quickly discovered that the staff of MCYS are strongly motivated by deeply held values and a keen sense of mission. Many have dedicated their entire professional lives to helping the needy and vulnerable, to build a resilient and cohesive society and to inspire young Singaporeans. I remain awed by their passion and dedication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
