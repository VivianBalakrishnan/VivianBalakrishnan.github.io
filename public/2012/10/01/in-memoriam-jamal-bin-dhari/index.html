He was a very good man, who used to drive me to many functions when I was at MND 10 years ago. When I apologised for making him work such long hours, his reply conveyed much political wisdom.
He told me that we should always try our best to accept all invitations because people wanted to know their leaders personally.">

<p>I was asked to convey the news to him last week that his illness was terminal. I told him that we could never return to the past, but he could count his blessing, including a wonderful family. He added, &#8220;and good friends&#8221;.</p>
<p>I was fortunate to have met him when I first started out in politics, to become his friend and will remember him dearly.</p>
