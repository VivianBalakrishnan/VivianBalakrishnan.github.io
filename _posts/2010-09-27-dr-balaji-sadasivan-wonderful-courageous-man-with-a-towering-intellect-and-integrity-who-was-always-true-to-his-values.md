<p>Dr Balaji Sadasivan passed away this morning. I knew him as a friend for over a decade, and knew of him even longer.</p>

<p>He was a great role model for all doctors and a wonderful colleague in politics. He had a towering intellect, capacious mind, deep curiosity and fine integrity. He was a principled man who was always true to his values, and did his best for his patients and the people of Singapore. His grace, equanimity, courage and dedication to public service in the last phase of his life despite his painful predicament was incredible. This is a terrible and painful loss for his family and all of us. No words or tears will do the man justice.</p>
