<p>The last few years of team building paid off as our boys showed great teamwork and some slick passing to defeat players who were clearly bigger and stronger.</p>

<p>I was so touched by their tribute to the late David Siva. Hope Singaporeans will fill every seat for their next match. They deserve our support.</p>
