<p>I am deeply grateful and so proud of our students and volunteers as they put on an incredible show that welcomed the world to Singapore last night. All of them made huge sacrifices of time and effort – for the sake of their team mates, their schools and Singapore. Everyone I met was truly impressed at the quality, and even more meaningful – the cheerfulness and zest for life that they demonstrated.</p>

<p>We had some anxious moments at the beginning. At 7:10 pm, BG Ishak informed me that the weather forecast was for a big thunderstorm. Ishak, Kee Nguan and I rushed up to the stands to see for ourselves huge ominous dark clouds. BUT it wasn&#8217;t raining yet. And the wind was blowing towards the sea.</p>

<p>We were sure that Singaporeans would not be deterred by rain even if it came.</p>

<p>We decided to proceed with the show (and prayed).</p>

<p>It was only after 8 pm when BG Ishak informed me on the hotline that the weather forecast had improved that I could finally relax and enjoy the show. We were blessed last night.</p>
