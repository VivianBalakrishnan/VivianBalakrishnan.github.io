<p>NEA-SIA Design Competition For BPHC</p>
<p>A design competition co-organised by NEA and the Singapore Institute of Architects (SIA) will be launched on 11 June for the design of the upcoming BPHC. NEA is seeking innovative new ideas from architects that address the local identity and context. In particular, special consideration will be placed on designs that are attractive, practical, cost effective, environmentally sustainable and promote social bonding.</p>
<p>The competition is open to all Singapore registered architects. Overseas architects who wish to participate can do so by partnering local registered architects. The competition will be organised in two stages with the first stage involving the submission of proposed designs for the hawker centre, and the second stage involving the submission of an architectural model with detailed plans for the shortlisted designs.</p>
<p>The winning design will be announced in October 2012. Construction work for the hawker centre is expected to commence in mid&#8211;2013 and completed by end&#8211;2014.</p>
<p>The Judging Panel will include Dr Teo Ho Pin, as well as representatives from the NEA, Singapore Institute of Architects and other relevant stakeholders. For more information on the design competition, please visit <a href="http://www.sia.org.sg">www.sia.org.sg</a>.</p>
<p>Appointment Of Manager</p>
<p>When the revised policy on hawker centres was announced in October 2011, I indicated that new centres should be run on a not-for-profit basis.  The Hawker Centre Public Consultation Panel subsequently suggested that a social enterprise or cooperative be appointed to manage these new centres. Pursuant to this suggestion, NEA has decided to appoint NTUC Foodfare to manage BPHC. NEA would like to encourage more social enterprises and cooperatives that are able to provide affordable food through a viable not-for-profit model to manage the other new centres that will be built in the future.</p>
<p>Advisor to Bukit Panjang SMC, Dr Teo Ho Pin shares, &#8216;I am pleased to know that Foodfare is running the Bukit Panjang Hawker Centre. I am confident that Foodfare will be able to provide competitive and good quality food for residents in Bukit Panjang&#8217;.</p>
<p>NEA will continue to explore various management models as long as they meet the objectives of keeping food prices affordable and ensuring patrons are able to enjoy a wide variety of food in a clean and hygienic environment.</p>
