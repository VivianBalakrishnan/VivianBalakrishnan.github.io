<p>Speech delivered at the 10th anniversary of the National Environment Agency on 15 September 2012.</p>
<ul>
<li>We celebrate 10 years of NEA&#8217;s partnership with all the stakeholders in our community to safeguard, nurture and cherish Singapore&#8217;s environment. In fact, this common cause dates back much longer – and we also remember the pioneers who formed the Ministry of the Environment almost 40 years ago on 16 Sep 1972.</li>
<li>During a recent trip to Tokyo, I asked to meet street cleaners. The diplomat who accompanied me told me this was not possible. She said there were no street cleaners. But when I looked out of the car, the street was spotless. She then recounted how she was scolded when she first arrived in Tokyo and tried to eat a sandwich as she strolled along the street. People stared at her, and told her pointedly not to mess up the street.</li>
<li>This episode made me pause to think about our own city. We are a very densely populated city. We have made tremendous efforts over the past decades to make Singapore Clean and Green. We have had many campaigns, instituted heavy fines, stepped up enforcement and employed an army of cleaners.</li>
<li>We have done reasonably well so far, but I want to offer one question for public discussion:</li>
</ul>
<p>Singapore – A Clean or Cleaned city?</p>

      <p>PUB recently announced <a href="http://www.pub.gov.sg/mpublications/Pages/PressReleases.aspx#" title="PUB press release - 19 July 2012">new measures to increase flood protection</a> at upstream areas of the Stamford Canal catchment area, including Orchard Road.The new measures include the construction of a new diversion canal to divert stormwater from about 240 hectares, or 38%, of the Stamford Canal catchment to Singapore River. Complementing the diversion canal is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detention_basin">detention tank</a> which will be built to capture excess stormwater from the existing drains along Holland Road. These measures will enhance drainage capacity for this upstream area and protect it against potentially more intense storms in the future.</p>

<p>&#8220;Minister, my question to you is two-fold. First, this plenary brings together our colleagues from water, city and the environment. What is the common thread that ties the three together, and what are some lessons learned that you would like to share with us?&#8221; </p>

<p>A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE
I thank members of the House for their questions and their suggestions.</p>
<p>2       There are three broad themes behind all of MEWR&#8217;s programmes. First, to ensure that we continue to have a very high quality of life in Singapore;  second, to do our part in an inclusive society, in particular, to always leave a low cost option on the table and also provide opportunities for fair wages and good jobs; and third, to make sure that we have a sustainable future.</p>
