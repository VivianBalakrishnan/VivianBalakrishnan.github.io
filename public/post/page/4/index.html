<p>Speech by Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, Committee of Supply Debate, 11 March 2014 (Section A)</p>
<p>Date Published: 11 Mar 2014</p>
<p>1.      Mdm Chair, my colleagues in NEA, PUB and MEWR have had a very busy year. In the space of 12 months, we have had to confront the worst haze episode ever; the worst dengue outbreak ever; we still had a couple of localised flash floods to deal with, and now we have the most prolonged dry spell ever. February has been the driest month on record and also the windiest month on record. We seem to be bent on breaking new records all the time.</p>

<p>Friends,</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen</p>

<p>1          I can honestly say friends because I can see many familiar faces, people who have been part of my life, and that of my ophthalmic colleagues here.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2          Donald has already given you a brief summary of Professor Lim&#8217;s multiple achievements. I don&#8217;t think I need to recite that. But I do want to beg your indulgence for me to have some license to ramble on about the lessons that I&#8217;ve learnt from Professor Lim over the years.</p>

<p>In 1982, my father bought my first computer – it was an Apple II Plus. Many of you here are too young to have used that venerable piece of technology.</p>

<p>(Why did you choose this place – Senja-Cashew Community Club – to meet for supper?)</p>
<p>This place has special significance. Back in 2006, we decided to build a pool in Bukit Panjang. However, it was supposed to be in another location further south.</p>
<p>My first post-election block visit was to a block opposite here. At the end of the visit, the grassroots leaders went to the top, looked down, saw this pond (by the current location of Senja-Cashew CC), and said, &#8220;Actually, the pond is the centre of the town. So, instead of building the pool in the original site, let&#8217;s build it here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edited excerpts of a speech I made at a NUS Commencement Ceremony on 14 July 2013.</p>
<p>Good morning and congratulations to those of you who are receiving your degrees today, and even heartier congratulations to the families that stand behind each one of you this morning.</p>
<p>There is a great difficulty in making speeches like this – I could read from the prepared text or I could tell you how I feel. If you do not mind, I want to tell you how I feel, not as a Minister, but speaking as someone who has walked in the shoes of everyone of you today, who is receiving a post-graduate degree.</p>

      <p>Many well-intended people advised me not to pursue this saga. It was too mundane, and people wanted to move on.</p>
<p>But I felt duty bound to resolve this matter, because it goes far beyond clean ceilings.</p>
<p>The core issue is integrity.</p>
<p>The Property Manager of AHPETC, Mr Tai Vie Shun, demanded extra money from hawkers for cleaning the high areas of hawker centres. He did so on three occasions – 8 March 2013, 26 April 2013 and 28 April 2013. The hawkers have confirmed this consistently, and their account is backed up by notes of meetings.</p>
