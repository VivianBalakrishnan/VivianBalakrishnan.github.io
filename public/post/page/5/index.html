<p>Our skies were blue and the air crystal clear today.</p>
<p>Had a long discussion in Parliament on the cause of the haze and our plans for the future. I thanked Singaporeans for your calmness, patience, and the fact that you refused to get rattled by the situation. It is that ability to respond sensibly, rationally, cohesively and collectively as a people that makes the difference and makes me confident that we will get through this together, whatever happens.</p>

<p>The world is currently at several inflexion points. There are now more than seven billion human beings on the planet, and more than half of us live in cities. Indeed, the most essential elements of life – food, water – are now interlinked with energy, and with fossil fuels. And this portends therefore, either a potential crisis or enormous opportunities for businesses in the years ahead.</p>
<p>In the past, great fortunes were made by simply extracting resources, mining materials – iron ore and energy – from the ground. And manufacturing grew enormously, on the back of the availability of cheap resources and cheap energy. But this era of cheap natural resources is coming to a close.  And we can now no longer afford to ignore the externalities of industrialisation and of human activities.  Pollution and global warming are real phenomena,  which affect not just the quality of the environment, but also involves huge economic costs for all of us. In other words, the old ways of getting rich are not going to be viable in the future.</p>

<p>Like many Singaporeans, I would also prefer to have a smaller population of foreigners in our Singapore but ……</p>
<p>We are facing the crisis of our lifetime. Our citizen population will halve every two generations. This is a serious &#8216;long&#8217; term problem and the only cure is more babies. But the real emergency is not babies, but ageing. That is why the population will increase in the short term before the inevitable decrease in the long term.</p>

It brought back many fond memories as my friend and I watched our sons don the same uniforms that we wore 45 years ago.</p>
<p>A new beginning for all our children – and may they fulfill all their dreams and destinies along the &#8216;path of the infinite&#8217;.</p>

<p>Christmas Eve 2012 fell on a Monday, and we spent it at the usual Monday Meet-the-People session. There were fewer residents than usual, but I was so grateful that we had a full complement of volunteers who were prepared to sacrifice time for a cause.</p>
<p>The combination of a festive air and basic challenges of life gave us food for thought as we shared a meal after the session.</p>

<p>Dear Prime Minister Lee and Minister of Environment and Water Resources Vivian,I write to the both of you because I and my society view&#8217;s this as a serious concern and it requires more</p>
<p>concerted and sustainable effort from the top right down to the bottom.</p>
<p>If you think we are a gracious society and very well behaved today, think again. At a recent public event (presumably attended mainly by our young population), the litter left behind on the floating platform gallery seats was really a sight to remember – it was appalling and frankly quite disgraceful. I am quite sure that the performers from Korea would have been shocked to see such an aftermath! The media gave good coverage on disappointed fans, but, nothing was mentioned about the mess left behind after the event.</p>
