<p>More than 2 decades ago, Professor Arthur Lim had a vision for a centre that would systematically attract, nurture and retain talented ophthalmologists in the public sector; be totally obsessed with quality control;; focus on research ( way before it became fashionable); establish deep relationships with other world class institutions and deliver cost effective patient centric care.</p>

<p>Many generations of eye care professionals and patients will owe him so much.</p>

<p>Congratulations to the whole SNEC family!</p>
