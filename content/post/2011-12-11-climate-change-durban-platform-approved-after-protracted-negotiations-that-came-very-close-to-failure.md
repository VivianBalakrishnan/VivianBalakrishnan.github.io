<p>It was a close shave. On several occasions over the past few days, and all night negotiations, failure seemed inevitable.</p>

<p>Fortunately, good sense and goodwill prevailed at the end.</p>

<p>There were 4 key components that were finely balanced.</p>

<p>First, the Kyoto Protocol will be extended through a second commitment period. The EU, Switzerland and Norway committed themselves to a legally binding ratifiable second commitment period. Unfortunately, Russia, Canada and Japan refused.</p>

<p>Second, a process to launch negotiations that will apply to all countries to either a new protocol or legal instrument or agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention will begin next year. A last minute dispute between the EU and India on this last point almost derailed the entire agreement.</p>

<p>Third, a new Green Climate Fund will be established.</p>

<p>Fourth, an agreement for the myriad details of the Long Term Cooperative Action was agreed. A key feature was increased transparency of the measures taken and outcomes.</p>

<p>If all these agreements are successfully implemented, this will be the most major step since the original Kyoto Protocol was signed in 1997.</p>

<p>Over the years, it has become increasingly obvious that not enough is being done to fulfill the aim of keeping global temperature rise to below 2 degrees. More needs to be done, and all countries will have to do more, taking into account our common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.</p>

<p>Singapore has a special challenge in being alternative energy disadvantaged. We are also vulnerable, given our low lying land area.</p>

<p>Much work remains to be done to future proof our homeland.</p>
