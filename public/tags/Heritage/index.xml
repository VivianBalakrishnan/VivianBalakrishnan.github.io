      <description>&lt;p&gt;This morning, the Ulu Pandan branch visited Mr Choo Siu Heng in hospital to celebrate National Day with him. He is now 81 years old and and has been a volunteer and activist since the mid 1950s. He was banished by the colonial authorities to China in 1956, and was allowed to return to Singapore only after the 1959 General Election. Since then, he has been a regular presence at Meet-the-People Sessions and community events for more than 5 decades.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bukit Panjang Primary School will always be special for me. Both my parents were teachers in the school during the 1950s. In fact, that&amp;#8217;s where they met and fell in love. So in a sense, I owe my existence to this school.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even today, many people still come up to tell me that my parents taught them so many years ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The invitation filled in parts of my maternal family history and family tree that I had previously not discovered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I now know that my family has been in Singapore for more than a century over at least 4 generations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
