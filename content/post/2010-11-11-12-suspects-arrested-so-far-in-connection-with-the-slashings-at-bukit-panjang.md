<p>Police telephoned me earlier this evening to inform me that they have arrested 12 young men so far.</p>

<p>The Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act provides for detention without trial in order to facilitate thorough investigations into cases like this. I am glad we still have these laws and an effective Police Force capable of quick and decisive action to break the backs of gangs like this.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t hesitate to call the Poice if you notice any suspicious people loitering in our neighbourhood.</p>
