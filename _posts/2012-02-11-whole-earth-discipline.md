<p>Peter Schwartz highly recommended this book when we met for dinner last week. It has been a mind blowing journey traversing ecology, urbanisation, climate change, transgenic crops, nuclear energy and geoengineering. We don&#8217;t have to agree on everything, but we must think carefully through these issues, and be prepared to change our minds as new information emerges.</p>
